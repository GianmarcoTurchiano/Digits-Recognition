# Value Proposition  
The primary end-users of this machine learning system are developers of applications that require to recognize handwritten digits. The system aims to provide an efficient and accurate way to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, serving as a foundational model for broader applications such as automated form processing and digital input systems. By leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN), users can achieve high accuracy and reliability in digit classification tasks with minimal preprocessing.

The workflow begins with the user inputting images of handwritten digits, which are then fed into the trained CNN model. The system predicts the digit displayed in the image and returns the result in real-time. 

# Prediction Task  
The task is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) into their respective classes. The CNN model learns to extract spatial and hierarchical features from the images, enabling it to distinguish between various digit shapes and styles.  

The model outputs a probability distribution over the 10 digit classes for each input image, with the highest probability corresponding to the predicted digit.  

# Decisions  
Once the model predicts the class of a digit, the result can be displayed to the user or used as input for downstream systems such as document processing workflows.

# Impact Simulation  
The model will be evaluated on a test set from the MNIST dataset to measure its accuracy and robustness before deployment.

The system's accuracy, precision, and recall will be tracked, along with its real-world impact on productivity and error reduction in applications.

# Making Predictions  
The system provides real-time predictions, with minimal latency between receiving an input image and outputting the predicted digit class.  

# Data Sources  
The MNIST dataset serves as the primary data source, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 28x28 grayscale handwritten digits.  
- Data includes labeled examples where each image is paired with its corresponding digit class.  
- The dataset is well-suited for supervised learning, as it is preprocessed and standardized.  

# Data Collection  
Data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, and random cropping are applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization to unseen examples.  

# Features  
The model input features are pixel values of the 28x28 grayscale images.

The output is a 10-dimensional probability vector, with each dimension representing the likelihood of the input image belonging to a specific digit class.  

# Building Models  
The CNN architecture includes:

- **Convolutional layers** for feature extraction (e.g., edge and shape detection).  
- **Fully connected layers** for final classification based on extracted features.  

Training and validation takes up to an hour, depending on the computational resources,

# Monitoring  
The following metrics are monitored to ensure optimal performance:  
- **Model metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score on the test set.  
- **System performance**: Latency, throughput, and uptime.
